"""General representation of a network of stoichiometric reactions.

An idealized representation of a pathway as a network of reactions, in which every reaction is all-or-nothing,
with strictly defined stoichiometry. The evolution of this network over time is determined by a
stoichiometry matrix, with molecules as the rows and reactions as the columns.

Some characteristics of typical reaction networks:
- In almost all cases we can assume the stoichiometry matrix to be sparse.
- For real biochemical systems, the total number of nonzero values is closer to linear with respect
  to the number of rows or columns than to the product of the two.
- Real reactions never involve more than a few molecules, so columns will likely never have more than
  a few nonzero values.
- The converse is not true: molecules such as ATP or water may each participate in many reactions, so
  the corresponding rows may have many nonzero values.
