# mosmo: *Mo*lecular *S*ystems *Mo*deling

A python-friendly framework for generalized modeling, analysis,
and simulation of systems composed of interacting molecules. The
package consists of
- **model**: classes and structures for representing the components
of a system.
- **knowledge**: a catalog of known system components and their attributes.
Described using **model** classes, and generally cross-referenced
to standard online databases.
- **calc**: algorithms and routines used to manipulate, analyze, and simulate
systems built with **model** classes (whether from the Knowledge Base
or not).
- **preso**: facilitates front-end interaction and visualization,
particularly in the context of Jupyter notebooks.
